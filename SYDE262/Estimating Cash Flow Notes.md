# Estimating Engineering Costs

## Engineering Costs
* **Fixed**: Constant regardless of output or activity
  * Faculty floor space, equipment, don't change with activity.
* **Variable**: Depend on level of output or activity.
  * Labour costs, more activity, more required.
* **Marginal**: Variable cost of one more unit
* **Average**: Total cost/number of units
* Sunk:
* Opportunity:

## Types of Estimates
* **Rough**: Used for high-level planning. Little detail or accuracy. -30% to 60% accuracy.
* **Budget**: Used for budgeting at conceptual or preliminary design stage. More detailed and require more time. Â±15% accuracy.
* **Detailed**: Used during detailed design and contract bidding. Made from detailed models, blueprints, specs, and vendor quotes. -3% to 5% accuracy.

## Difficulties in Estimates
### One-of-a-Kind
One of a kind and first-run projects are difficult to estimate due to not having previous experience (historical data). For example, with the original NASA missions, the US did not have any experience in manned space flight so design, production and launch costs were "one-of-a-kind" or "first time" estimates.

However, looking to a *close cousin*, can help alleviate this. This is called **estimation by analogy**. For example, NASA used previously understood labour costs of the aircraft industry.

### Time and availibility
Only so much labour and time can be used for an estimate. Depending on the type of estimate, adjust the amount of resources spent accordingly.

### Estimator Expertise
Experience is built in industry to help make estimates on a body of knowledge in a particular area. Strategies:

1. Assign inexperienced engineers relatively small jobs in order to create expertise.
2. Pair inexperienced engineers with mentors who have vast technical experience.
3. Technical boards and review meetings are assembled to review the budgets and gain experience together.
4. Maintain databases of past estimates and actual costs inccured.

## Estimating Models
### Per-unit
Very simplistic. Does not make allowances for economies of scale.

### Segmenting
"Divide" the estimate into categories. "Conquer"/find out the the cost of each category. Then bring it all back together. A **work breakdown structure** can be employed during this phase to budget and *also* project manage.

### Cost Indexes
Cost indexes are published by private and public sources. Cost indexes are published for labour, construction and materials. Using historical and current cost indexes with historical cost data, we can find the current cost. 
$$\frac {\text{Cost at Time A}} {\text{Cost at Time B}} = \frac {\text{Cost Index at Time A}} {\text{Cost Index at Time B}} $$
