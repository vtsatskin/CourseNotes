# SYDE 212: Probability and Statistics

We reviewed the course outline.

## What is statistics?
Statistics is involved any time when you want to observe the world around you.  It is not just data collection. You learn something of interest by collecting data.

###  Sample Articles
* "Video games can help cut surgical errors"
* "Poll: Half believe Congress is Dirty"
* "Being high is good for you"
* "Java jolts workers' short-term memory"
* "Survey: Users change habits to avoid spyware"
* "Cell phones may hurt sperm"

### Components of Statisical Studies

You want to know wether or not surgeons should be playing video games. What should we do?

1. Identify the problem of interest
	* What population of people?
    	* How do we select an unbiased sample?
    * How are you going to select the sample?
      * What demographics of surgeons?
      * E.g. All North American surgeons doing a particular procedure
      * How do we ensure an unbiased sample?
   * What are we going to measure on to answer the question?
	   * How do you define a surgical error?
       * Instead of choosing to analyize errors, they choose to use length of time.
   * What video game are you going to use?

As we can see, there's a whole lot of stuff we have to do ever before we collect the data. As mentioned before, statistics is not just about collecting and analyzing data. 

Quote from the article:
"Researchers found that surgeons who played video games immediately before drill complete it an **average of 11 seconds faster** than those who did not."

### Rationale for randomization
* Those who like video games may have a tendency to be younger surgeons
  * Younger surgeons may be more or less dexterous
