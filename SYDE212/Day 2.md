# SYDE 212: Probability and Statistics

### Study: Video games can help cut surgical errors
> Researches found that surgeons who played video games immediately before the drill completed it **an average of 11 seconds faster** than those who did not.

* 300 surgeons placed randomly in one of the groups:
  1. Video game usage prior to surgery
  2. No video game usaged


Let $\overline X_{v}$ be mean time to completion of video game group..

Let $\overline X_{n}$ be mean time of the no-video group.

According to the report: $\overline X_{n} - \overline X_{v} = 11 s$

Imagine two scenarios which will have the same $\overline X_{n}$ and $\overline X_{v}$. Scenario 1 has low variance, whereas Scenario 2 has a high variation between sample points.

If you were to repeat the study in scenario 1 over and over again, you will most likely get the same $\overline X_{n}$ and $\overline X_{v}$. Whereas if you were to do the same for scenario 2, you would most likely not have the same $\overline X_{n}$ and $\overline X_{v}$.

If you were to do the study again, over and over again, with different samples, you would most likely get a different $\overline X_{n} - \overline X_{v}$. Now we must look at the distribution of means.
