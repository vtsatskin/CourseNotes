Normal Stress = $ \sigma = \frac P A $
Shear Stress = $ \tau = \frac V A $

* If $P > 0$: Tension, Tensile Normal Stress
* If $P < 0$: Compression, Compressive Normal Stress
* No such thing as a tensile or compressive shear stress

With every stress there is a corresponding distortion. To characterize the change in length due to a normal stress we use

$$\epsilon = \frac {\Delta L}{L} = \frac {\text{Change in Length}}{\text{Original Length}}$$

The relationship between $\sigma + \epsilon$ is determined experimentally.
