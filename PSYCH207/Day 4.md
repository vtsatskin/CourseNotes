# PSYCH 207: Cognitive Processes

### Comparitive Psychology
Looking at other species to understand how the human brain works.

* Crows have social learning and tool use. Similiar brain structure.

## Perception
"There is no truth. There is only perception."

We filter out a lot of the information that is around us.

The **distal stimulus** (outside in the world) does not corespond to the **proximal stimulus** (image in the mind). 

### Bottom-Up Process
* The stimulus compeltely determines final percept
* Goes in one direction, from stimulus to output.

**Template matching**

* Correspondence between external stimulus and stored pattern in memory. 
* Needs lots of templates
* Does not explain how we recognize new objects
* Does not deal with **surface variation** of stimuli

**Feature analysis**

* Objects are combinations of **features**
* Small templates that can be cobined in many different ways.
* Recgonize features then recognize combination
* Advantages
  * More Flexible over template matching
  * Does not need to be an exact template.
* In Nature
  * Frogs use Edge detection: fire in response to borders between light and dark.
  * Frogs use Bug detectors: fire in response to small dots moving through visual field.

**Prototype Matching**

* Matching pattern to stored representation (a prototype).
* An exact match is not required as in template matching.
* **Prototype:** an idealized representation of some class of objects.
* The more features shares with a prototype, the higher the likelihood that it is a match
* Much more flexible than other models.

### Top-Down Processes

Also called "theory-driven" or "conceptually drive" processing. Person's knowledge, theories, expectations influence perceptions (based on **experience**). Your expecations mess with the bottom-up processes occuring and alter your perception.

* Context Effects
  * Depending on the context you are viewing something 
* Change Blindness
  * Occurs when a change in a visual stimulus goes unnoticed by the observer.
  * For example, an individual fails to notice a difference between two images that are identical except for one change.
