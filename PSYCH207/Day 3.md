## Associations
Two imparments are both present in the same patient. 

Example: 

## Dissociation
One impairent is present and other other is absent.

## Double Dissociation
Two patients. Both show a dissociation but in the opposite directons. In a single person: content related.

**Example:** P1 is impaired in task X but not Y. P2 is impaired in task Y but on X.

### Broca's and Wernicke's Area

* An example of double dissociation
* Patient A with damage to Broca's area loses the ability to speak works.
* Patient B with damage to Wernicke's area loses the ability to understand words.
* Both patients have no problems in either's difficiancies

## Delusions
A false belief someone maintains even after obvious proof and the majority of the population believe.

2 factor theory of delusional belief

1. Where does the delusion come from?
2. Why is it not rejected?
  * Right hemisphere lobe damage.
  
### Examples
**Somatoparaphrenia**

"This isn't my arm, it's my husband's"
* Brain damage that precludes movement of arm.
* Damage to belief system.

**Alien Control Delusion**

* Failure of correspondence between expected and obtained sensory feedback.
* Damage to belief system.

**Mirrored-self misidentification**

"The person I see when I look in the mirror isn't me, but some stranger who looks like me"

* Deficit in face processing regions
* Mirror agnosia

* Damage to belief system.

**Capgras Delusion**

"My wife has been replaced by an impostor"

* Brain damage that disconnects face recognition system from automatic nervous system.
* Damage to belief system.

**Fregoli Delusion**

"People I know are following me around, but in disguise, so I can never recognize them"

* Autonomic hyperreactivity to faces
* Damage to belief system.

**Cotard Delusion**

"I am dead"

* Pure autonomic failure. No emotional response.
* Damage to belief system.

## Neuroimaging
* CAT
* MRI
* PET
* fMRI
* EEG
* ERP

### Functional Neuroimaging 
* Electrical activity
  * Event-related potentials (ERP), derivative from EEG
  * Spikes in electrical electricity seen at the surface level due to external stimulus.
* Metabolism
  * Blood exygenated level dependant (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI).
