# Thinking and Problem Solving

## Thinking Definition

- "going beyond the information given" - Bruner
- "a complex and high-level skill" that “fill[s] up gaps in the evidence”  - Bartlett

### Focused
- Clear starting point and has a specific goal

### Unfocused
- Sort of like daydreaming
- Calling to mind a number of different and loosely related ideas.

## Introspection
- The key to proper use of this technique is to avoid doing more than is asked for: Don’t explain or justify what you’re thinking about, just report it.

## Well-defined problems
- Have a clear goal
- Small set of initial data
- Often present rules to follow while solving
- Opposite of **ill-defined** rules
- Psychologists have focused on well-defined problems for several reasons
	- Easy to present
	- Short amount of time to solve
	- Easy to score
	- Easy to change.
- **Experiment**: Schraw, Dunkle, and Bendixen (1995) demonstrated that performance on well-defined problems was not correlated with performance on an ill-defined one.

## Classic Problems and General Methods of Solution

### Generate and Test Technique
- Generate possible solutions and test their validity
- Loses effectiveness when there are many possible answers and no guidance for solution generation

### Means-End Analysis
- **Experiment**: Newell and Simon (1972) gave several problems in logic and in crypt arith- metic to both human participants and GPS
	- Concluded that there were many similarities between the performance of GPS and the perfor- mance of the Yale students who served as participants. 
- More focused of a method than generate and test
- Can make it more difficult to see that the most efficient path toward a goal isn’t always the most direct one.

### Working Backward
- Find the last step needed then second last and so on
- Working backward is most effective when the backward path is unique

### Reasoning by Analogy
- **Experiment**: Participants were told to read Story of the General and then Tumor problem
	- Only 30% of participants spontaneously noticed the analogy.
	- 75% solved the problem if told that the story of the general would be useful in constructing the solution.
- **Experiment**: Modification of previous experiment with no direct hints
	- Participants were told to write summaries of two analogus stories
	- This formed an abstract schema for solving the tumor problem

## Blocks to Problem Solving 
### Mental Set
- The tendency to adopt a certain framework, strategy, or procedure or, more generally, to see things in a certain way instead of in other, equally plausible ways.
- Mental set often causes people to make certain unwarranted assumptions without being aware of making them.

### Using Incomplete or Incorrect Representations
- The representation of a problem can either make it easy or difficult to solve
- E.g. Numbers game representation: either list of numbers or tic-tac-toe grid.

### Lack of Problem-Specific Knowledge or Expertise
- Familiarity with a domain of knowledge seems to change the way one solves problems within that frame of reference. 
- Experts are able to sort out relevant information from irrelevant
- **Experiment**: Chess novice vs expert
	- Master players considered about the same number of possibilities but somehow chose the best move more easily.
	- More expertise a chess player had, the more information he extracted even from brief exposures to chessboards set up to reflect an ongoing chess game
	- Superiority came from ability to recognize patterns more than from his ability to plan future moves. 
- **Brain Stuff**: Damage to right prefrontal cortex caused damage to problem solving abilities

## Problem Space Hypothesis
- Every possible state within a problem is represented as a graph of nodes
- Searches that fail to explore parts of the space (because of mental set, for example) can block problem solving when the solution lies in a part of the space that isn’t searched.
- Incomplete or incorrect representations are likely to result in the construction of an incomplete or in- correct problem space, which in turn also harms problem solving.

## Expert Systems
- Computer programs designed to mimic an expert's knowledge.
- Built up upon many sessions of many experts being questioned about their domain knowledge
- Useful for creating a knowledge base that is not biased (as experts may be plagued by this)
- Useful for allowing expert systems in places where not enough domain experts are available

## Finding creative solutions
### Unconscious Processing and Incubation
### Everyday Mechanisms
- **Directed remembering**: This is the ability to channel your memory in order to make conscious some past experience or knowledge that meets various constraints. This knowledge constrains the kinds of solutions one may come up with.
- **Noticing**: literally noticing things
- **Contrary recognition**: The ability to recognize objects not for what they are but as something else.

## Critical Thinking
- Asking Critical questions:
	- Does the proposed solution really meet all the objectives and constraints?
	- Are there hidden or subtle flaws in the idea?
	- What are the proposal's implications?
