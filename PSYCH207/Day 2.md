# PSYCH 207: Cognitive Processes
## Empiricism
* Association between experiences

## Nativism
* Emphasis on that which is innate

## Structuralism
* Focus on individual components of the mind.

## Functionalism
* William James
* Function is more important than little pieces. Bigger picture.
* We should think about why our minds work the way it does?
* Introspection in natural settings

## Gestalt
* Interested in holistic aspects instead of decomposition of conscious experience.
* "The whole is greater than the sum of the parts."
* The question arises, how much should be decompose vs looking at larger perspective

## Cognition vs Behaviour
* Frued's introspection would revert everything back to previous experience
* Watson, wanted to have a scentific method of doing the pyschology.

## Behaviourism
* Watson, Skinner
* If we can predict behaviour, then we've done a pretty good job.
* However, they didn't want to deal with what was happening inside the mind.
* This was due to not knowing what was happening inside the mind at the time.
* Wanted to clean up the mess that was introspection.
