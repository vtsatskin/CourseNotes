## Properties of Circuit Components
### Idependant Voltage Sources
### Idependant Current Sources
### Dependant Power Sources
* Dependant voltage/current is controled by some other voltage or current n the circuit.
* E.g. base current controls collector current in a biopolar junction transistor

**Voltage Controlled Voltage Source (VCVS)**

$v_{i}$ is idependent control voltage across some speciied circuit element(s)

**Current Controlled Voltage Source (VCVS)**
**Voltage Controlled Voltage Source (VCVS)**

### Resistor
* Linear, lumped (all resistance is existing in one point in space), time invariant of specific geometry and material composition. They provide a certain amount of ohmic resistance
$$ R = \frac V I $$
* **Wattage rated**: All energy going through a resistor is disipated as heat. If the resistor can't disipate the heat, you've got a problem.

### Capacitor
$$ C = \frac q V $$
* **Voltage rated**: If you increase the voltage between plates, the electric field between the plates

### Inductor
$$ L = \frac \Lambda I $$
* **Current rated**

### Diodes
* **Current rated**

## Kirchoff's Voltage Law
* Based on principle of conservation of energy
*
